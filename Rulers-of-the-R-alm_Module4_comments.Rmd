# Introduction
In the anole project, we are focusing on assessment of morphological and allometric differences within anoles, in particular, visualization and analyzation of hind-limb length and size covariation within niches. @hagey2017there is a recent study that was concerned with the hindlimb-ecomorph relationship of anoles. In this study, they phylogenetic GLS models to analyze their data, which are the same type of models that we will use to answer our question.

# Methods
In order to answer our question, we will create four different PGLS models and then compare them to determine which has the best fit according to a similar method used by @Chen2022. To compare our models, we will use AIC operations, in particular AICc and AICw, and which ever model has the best results will tell us what the answer to our question is.

### Adding Code with Chunks
```{r}
x<-1:100
mean(50)
```

```{r, "load the data"}
anole <- read_csv("anole.dat.csv")
anole.eco <- read_csv("anole.eco.csv")
anole.tree <- read.tree("anole.tre")
```

```{r, "join, filter, mutate to log"}
anole2 <- anole%>%
left_join(anole.eco)%>%
  filter(!Ecomorph%in%c("U","CH"))%>%
  na.omit()

anole.log <- anole2%>%
  mutate_at(c("SVL", "HTotal","PH","ArbPD"),log)
```

# Results
The results show that PGLS under BM with ecomorphological data is the best model. This can be taken to mean that the traits have evolved randomly within each lineage specifically.

```{r, "PGLS models"}
### phylogenetic GLS models

#PGLS under BM, no ecomorph
pgls.BM1 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL, correlation = corBrownian(1,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")

#PGLS under BM, w ecomorph
pgls.BM2 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL * Ecomorph2, correlation = corBrownian(1,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")

#PGLS under OU, no ecomorph
pgls.OU1 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL, correlation = corMartins(0,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")

#PGLS under OU, w, ecomorph
pgls.OU2 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL * Ecomorph2, correlation = corMartins(0,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")
```

```{r, "AIC"}
#AIC operations
anole.phylo.aic <- AICc(pgls.BM1,pgls.BM2,pgls.OU1,pgls.OU2)
anole.phylow.aicw <- aicw(anole.phylo.aic$AICc)
```

```{r, "Altered AIC"}
#AIC ALTERED operations
kable(anole.phylo.aic, caption = "AIC Summary for Anole Phylogenetic Models")
```

```{r, "Regression Plot"}
ggplot(anole.log, aes(x = SVL, y = HTotal, color = Ecomorph2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r, "add residuals"}
#add phylo-corrected residuals
anole.log <- anole.log%>%
  mutate(phylo.res=residuals(pgls.BM2))
```

```{r,"plot residuals", fig.cap="Boxplot of phylogenetically corrected hindlimb residuals versus anole ecomorph"}
#plot residuals
p.eco.phylo <- anole.log%>%
ggplot(aes(x=Ecomorph2,y=phylo.res)) +geom_boxplot() +stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="point", size=3)

print(p.eco.phylo)
```

# Discussion
The results indicate that the traits evolve randomly within each ecological niche. This signifies that each niche has a particular hind-limb to body length ratio that is advantageous there in particular. 

# Author Contributions
Ana produced the AIC table and wrote the Author Contributions. Lauren created the regression plot, and created the reference file. Blake added an image of an anole and wrote the introduction. Vanessa wrote the Methods, Results, and Discussion.

Nice work, especially considering this was your first crack at something like this!
